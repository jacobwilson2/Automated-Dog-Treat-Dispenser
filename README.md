# Automated-Dog-Treat-Dispenser

Contributors: Jacob Wilson & Danielle Seedman

Description:

For our project, we created a cyber-physical computing system that automatically dispenses dog treats when a dog stands within
a certain distance from a sensor. The system is powered by a 5V power supply and driven by a stepper motor driver. The motor 
connects to an arm used as a pushing mechanism that dispenses the treats. After a dog is detected and the treat is dispensed, 
the system takes a picture using a Raspberry Pi camera, and then sends the picture to a specified email address with a 
timestamp so the owner can monitor the dog’s treat eating habitats.
